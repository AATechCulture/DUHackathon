This directory contains the dataset used to train both a Random Forest Classification and Regressor model. The dataset `Austin_Rainfall_95.csv` is based on 95 years of monthly and annual rainfall in Austin, Texas as well as whether a flood occurred during that year. Using this data, we were able to predict 1 to 5 years of annual rainfall and whether a flood will occur during 
those years by creating a Python script `flood_prediction.py`. 

`processed_data.csv` and `processed_data_corrected.csv` are files created while generating the flood risk prediction and used to create the final predictions `flood_and_rainfall_predictions_2008_2012.csv`

The data generated here will be used on our web application to show the level of flood risk from low to high based on statistics like mean, median, minimum, and maximum annual rainfall when floods do or do not occur.
